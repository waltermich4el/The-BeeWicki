## The BeeWicki


The BeeWicki is a **MIDI controller** based on the Wicki Layout.
The notes to the left are a full tone up, notes to the right are a full tone lower.
Upper left is a perfect fourth, upper right a perfect fifth and directly above would be an octave higher.

The keyboard utilises a pushbutton matrix with diodes
having the columns set as outputs and Â the rows as inputs.
As for the microcontroller, an **ATMEGA32U4** microprocessor
was used which has the properties of being MIDI USB compliant.
No Further software is needed to "translate" the packages sent.

As a compiler, the Arduino IDE 1.8.19 was used.
